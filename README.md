Thinking out loud about an authoritative server implementation

`npm start`

Starts a server on port 40401 and then serves the /client project via Budo server.

(Budo, or whatever server you use for serving files. Client needs to be served with budo because Game code is shared via symlink that doesn't work from file://)
